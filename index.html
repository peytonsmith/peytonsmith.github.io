<H1><b>Welcome to Peyton Smith's Webpage</b></H1>

<H2>A student in the Maine Business School at the University of Maine</H2>


<p>Welcome to my webpage! I hope you enjoy learning about the many things that keep my life busy!</p>

<p>My name is Peyton Smith. I am 18 years old. I graduated from Hampden Academy in 2018, and am now a freshman at the University of Maine. <a href="https://umaine.edu">Umaine</a> was the only school I applied to, for I wanted to stay close to home. I have enjoyed keeping my life busy here by being involved in intramurals and greeklife. </p>
