<h1>College</h1>
<p>I am a freshman at the University of Maine and I am studying accounting. I joined a sorority in the fall and have been enjoying the great friendships I am making. On the weekdays I spend my time playing intramurals and studying. On the weekends I love to go skiing at Sugarloaf. </p>
